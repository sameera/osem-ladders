# Technical Execution
## Code & Implementation
1. Implements and maintains product or system features with good and maintainable code
2. Delivers technical solutions with minimal guidance.
3. Writes reliable code across full SSDLC, with exemplary use of patterns and practices.
4. Raises quality bar through craftsmanship and rigorous application of best practices.
    This is someone who doesn't just meet expectations, but improves them by demonstrating a high standard of care, discipline and pride in their coding practices, and encouraging others to do the same, thereby lifting the overall quality of the engineering output. They emphasize writing well-tested, performant, maintainable code with sound structure and minimal technical debt. Also includes rigorous code reviews, consistency in patterns, and use of automation to catch defects early. You'll find them regularly digging through old code and sparking conversations on edge cases, inefficiencies or even just "how this could have been done better".
5. Sustained history of creating major improvements in large, complex, team-critical systems
    Complex systems refer to those with meaningful architectural or operational depth - involving distributed components, scalability or performance trade-offs, state management across boundaries, integration surfaces, and long-lived dependencies (such as thirdparty auth systems, MQs, observerbility tools).

    Staff Engineers are not just a result of individual career growth—they are necessitated by the complexity of modern, scalable enterprise systems. As systems grow in architectural depth and operational scale, they demand technical leaders who meet an industry-wide standard of expertise and can drive high-impact outcomes across teams and domains.
6. Builds foundational improvements that increase org effectiveness
    At this level, the engineer moves beyond contributing to or improving isolated systems and begins to **intentionally design and deliver foundational enhancements** that elevate the performance, velocity, and quality of the **entire engineering organization**. This may include rethinking architectural patterns, creating shared libraries or infrastructure, or introducing practices that eliminate recurring friction across teams.

    What sets this apart from L5 is **scale and abstraction** — while a Staff Engineer may drive improvements in complex, team-critical systems, a Senior Staff Engineer looks for **cross-cutting pain points** and builds durable solutions that other engineers and teams can build upon. Their work often impacts hiring productivity, onboarding speed, test reliability, deployment velocity, or system observability — elements that unlock effectiveness across multiple domains.

    For example, a Senior Staff Engineer might redesign the platform's CI/CD pipeline to make builds 70% faster and dramatically more reliable. When this is done for a complex system (as described elswhere) this is a force multiplier that gives **every team in the org more speed, confidence, and delivery bandwidth.**
7. Leads implementation of critical infrastructure with company-wide impact
    At L7, the engineer is entrusted with the **design and delivery of foundational systems that serve as critical enablers for the entire company**, not just the engineering org. This is not about optimizing existing flows or delivering high-impact features — this is about **creating or reshaping infrastructure that the business itself depends on to scale, differentiate, or survive**.

    This level surpasses L6 in two key ways: **scope and risk**. While L6 builds systems that improve how engineering works, L7 **owns infrastructure that affects products, users, or business continuity across multiple lines of business**. Their work typically involves **navigating deep uncertainty**, solving intractable problems, and aligning diverse stakeholders to converge on bold, long-term solutions.

    A practical example: leading the implementation of a unified data platform that consolidates fragmented analytics pipelines across teams, ensuring regulatory compliance, enabling real-time insights for product and marketing, and forming the backbone for ML use cases — all while replacing legacy systems with minimal business disruption.

    This is the level where implementation choices carry **strategic weight**, and success means the entire company runs more reliably, securely, and effectively because of the system you led into existence.

## System Design & Architecture
1. Translates solutions defined by senior engineers, in to efficient code.
2. Able to scope and estimate assigned tasks independently.
3. Scopes solutions across SSDLC; anticipates edge cases and risks and mitigates them.
4. Designs scalable, robust architectures that are resource-efficient and cost-effective.
    At this level, the engineer designs systems that are not only functional but **scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient**. They apply architectural principles to optimize for long-term performance, reliability, and maintainability — not just immediate delivery.

    This goes beyond level 3 by showing **strategic intent** in balancing technical trade-offs and resource constraints. For example, they may introduce caching to reduce load, restructure workflows to minimize latency, or choose async patterns to improve scalability — all while keeping cost and simplicity in mind.

    Their designs consistently reflect an awareness of **future growth and system impact**, making them trusted contributors to durable, production-grade architecture.
5. Leads architectural decisions and owns the design of complex, multi-system solutions with broad impact.
    This level marks a shift from designing within a single system to **taking ownership of architecture that spans multiple systems or services**, often involving coordination across teams. The engineer drives architectural decisions, aligning design with product requirements, operational needs, and long-term scalability goals. They’re expected to navigate complexity — such as distributed ownership, integration boundaries, and inconsistent data models — and produce coherent solutions that reduce system friction and avoid duplication.

    Progressing from level 4, which focuses on scalable design within a well-defined context, this level introduces **cross-system accountability**. For example, designing a customer data pipeline that integrates data across billing, CRM, and product telemetry systems, while maintaining integrity, performance, and clear ownership boundaries. They are relied on to **lead architectural discussions**, gain buy-in, and document design decisions that will guide multiple teams over time — but unlike L6, their scope typically stops at the department or product-line level.
6. Owns and evolves system-level architecture across teams and domains, ensuring scalability, resilience, and strategic alignment with business needs.
    At this level, the engineer is responsible for **maintaining and evolving architecture that spans multiple teams and product domains**, ensuring that foundational systems remain adaptable as business priorities and technical constraints shift. Their work moves beyond solutioning for known requirements — they actively shape how systems **should evolve** to support future capabilities, scalability, and reliability.

    Building on level 5, where the focus is designing multi-system solutions, level 6 requires **long-term architectural stewardship**. For instance, they might define and evolve a shared platform API strategy used across product lines, ensuring it scales without duplicating functionality or blocking downstream teams. They also maintain **alignment with broader org strategy**, collaborating with engineering and product leadership to ensure architectural direction supports company goals. Unlike level 7, they typically influence within department/product-line boundaries, rather than across the entire company.
7. Leads the design of cross-cutting systems and critical infrastructure, solving problems with company-wide blast radius and long-term impact.
    At this level, the engineer drives the design of systems that are **core to the company’s operational and product infrastructure**, with influence that spans multiple organizations or business units. Their solutions are built to endure — enabling business agility, protecting against systemic risks, and supporting scale far beyond current needs. These systems often form the foundation on which other teams build, such as authentication, data platforms, observability stacks, or deployment frameworks.

    This goes beyond level 6’s architectural stewardship across teams and domains by introducing **company-wide reach and criticality**. For example, they may lead the re-architecture of a service mesh to unify service discovery, security, and observability across all environments, while ensuring minimal downtime during adoption. These initiatives require them to align diverse stakeholders, anticipate broad downstream effects, and make decisions that balance present needs with multi-year strategic objectives.

## Technical Breadth & Expertise
1. Demonstrate strong fundamentals and is focused on growing as an engineer, learning advanced tools and processes
2. Solves complex problems with the guidence of senior engineers.
3. Applies deep domain expertise to guide design, architecture, and tool selection across the team.
4. Deep understanding in more than one component or technology with significant familiarity across all aspects of the product. 
    At level 4, the engineer demonstrates **deep expertise in multiple key components or technologies**, while also maintaining a strong working knowledge of how the entire product fits together. They are able to **identify system-level implications** of local changes, guide integration work across components, and foresee technical risks or misalignments before they become blockers.

    This is a progression from level 3, which focuses on domain-specific depth. At level 4, the engineer is expected to work comfortably across boundaries, often bridging multiple teams or systems. For example, they might be the go-to person for both the billing engine and the authentication module, while also understanding how those tie into deployment workflows and user-facing flows. This breadth enables them to contribute meaningfully to technical discussions outside their core focus and to help others reason about system-wide effects.
5. Brings deep product-wide expertise and influences technical direction through trade-off analysis.
    At level 5, the engineer possesses comprehensive expertise across the entire product or platform, enabling them to recognize and influence technical direction through principled trade-off analysis. Their depth allows them to anticipate edge cases, interdependencies, and risks that might not be obvious to others. They are often sought out to help evaluate build vs. buy decisions, refactor proposals, or system design choices that affect long-term flexibility and maintainability.

    This represents a clear step beyond level 4, where expertise is distributed across components with broad familiarity. Here, the engineer operates with confidence across all major areas of the system, using that understanding to make recommendations that are aligned with both engineering standards and business context. Their input begins to carry strategic weight, informing decisions that influence how the product evolves and how teams operate around it.
6. Is the go-to technical authority for one or more major systems or domains; mentors Staff+ engineers in navigating complexity and making trade-offs.
    At level 6, the engineer is recognized across the organization as the **definitive expert in one or more major systems or technical domains** — not only for their deep knowledge, but for their ability to apply that expertise in situations with high ambiguity, complexity, or risk. They are frequently consulted to **resolve architectural disputes**, lead deep-dive investigations, or unblock critical initiatives that require clarity and judgment.

    This is a clear progression from level 5, where influence is driven by broad product-wide expertise. At level 6, the engineer becomes a **trusted advisor to other senior engineers**, including Staff+, helping them navigate high-stakes technical decisions through mentorship, critical review, and trade-off analysis. For instance, they may guide another team through a rewrite of a core system, advising on performance implications, cross-team dependencies, and long-term maintainability, while staying above the implementation detail unless needed.
7. Shapes architecture patterns and technical standards adopted across teams and business units; ensures coherence across platforms and domains. Acts as a force multiplier across functions, partnering with product, design, and business stakeholders to define and deliver strategic initiatives.
    At level 7, the engineer operates as a **cross-functional technical strategist**, shaping **architecture patterns and standards** that are broadly adopted across multiple teams and business units. Their primary focus is not just technical excellence, but ensuring **consistency, scalability, and strategic alignment** across the organization’s technical landscape. They identify fragmentation or inefficiencies at the platform level and work to unify and elevate engineering practice through codified standards, reusable frameworks, and system-wide guidance.

    This level builds on the deep domain leadership of level 6 by adding **organizational influence and systemic scale**. Rather than being the go-to expert for a few systems, they set the direction for **how systems should be built across the company**. For example, they might define the company’s event-driven architecture standard, gain alignment across multiple orgs, and lead the adoption effort — all while ensuring the design supports business agility, product velocity, and future extensibility. Their work **enables hundreds of engineers to move faster and more cohesively**, making them a true force multiplier.
